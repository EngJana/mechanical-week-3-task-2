# 3-DoF Robotic Arm Kinematics

A mathematical model of a three-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, focusing on both forward and inverse kinematics. 
Detailed transformation matrices and equations to understand and compute the arm's movements. 

# Forward Kinematics in 3D

Forward kinematics in 3D involves determining the position \((x, y, z)\) and orientation of the end-effector given the joint parameters.

## Assumptions
- The robot has three rotational joints.
- The links are defined by lengths L1, L2, and L3.
- The joint angles are Œ∏1, Œ∏2, and Œ∏3.

## Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters
The DH convention simplifies the process of modeling robotic arms by assigning a coordinate frame to each joint and defining a set of four parameters that describe the relative positions of these frames. The four DH parameters are:

**ùëéùëñ (Link Length):**
- The distance between the \(z_{i-1}\) and \(z_i\) axes measured along the \(x_i\) axis.
- This parameter represents the length of the common normal between the two successive joint axes.

**Œ±i (Link Twist):**
- The angle between the \(z_{i-1}\) and \(z_i\) axes measured around the \(x_i\) axis.
- This parameter represents the twist angle between the two successive joint axes.

**di (Link Offset):**
- The distance between the \(x_{i-1}\) and \(x_i\) axes measured along the \(z_i\) axis.
- This parameter represents the offset along the previous \(z\)-axis to the common normal.

**Œ∏i (Joint Angle):**
- The angle between the \(x_{i-1}\) and \(x_i\) axes measured around the \(z_i\) axis.
- This parameter represents the rotation around the previous \(z\)-axis to align the \(x\)-axes.

## Defining DH Parameters for a 3-DoF Robot
Let's define the DH parameters for a 3-DoF robotic arm, which typically has three revolute joints. We'll explain how each parameter is derived based on the arm's configuration.

**Joint 1 (Base to Link 1)** 
- a1=0: Since the base is fixed and there is no offset along the \(x_1\) axis.
- ùõº1=0: There is no twist angle between the base and the first joint.
- d1: This is the distance from the base to the first joint along the \(z_1\) axis, which is usually a fixed length.
- Œ∏1: This is the rotation around the \(z_1\) axis, which is the first joint angle.

**Joint 2 (Link 1 to Link 2)**
- a2=L1: The length of the first link along the \(x_2\) axis.
- ùõº2=0: There is no twist angle between the first and second joints.
- d2=0: There is no offset along the \(z_2\) axis for a revolute joint.
- Œ∏2: This is the rotation around the \(z_2\) axis, which is the second joint angle.

**Joint 3 (Link 2 to Link 3)**
- a3=L2: The length of the second link along the \(x_3\) axis.
- ùõº3=0: There is no twist angle between the second and third joints.
- d3=0: There is no offset along the \(z_3\) axis for a revolute joint.
- Œ∏3: This is the rotation around the \(z_3\) axis, which is the third joint angle.

For a 3-DoF robot, the DH parameters might look like:

| Joint | ai | 	ùõºi | di | Œ∏i |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| 1     | 0      | 0            | d1 | Œ∏1 |
| 2     | L1 | 0            | 0      | Œ∏2 |
| 3     | L2 | 0            | 0      | Œ∏3 |

Using these parameters, the transformation matrices for each joint are:

$$ 
T_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(Œ∏1) & -\sin(Œ∏1) & 0 & 0 \\
\sin(Œ∏1) & \cos(Œ∏1) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & d_1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$ 
T_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(Œ∏2) & -\sin(Œ∏2) & 0 & L_1 \cos(Œ∏2) \\
\sin(Œ∏2) & \cos(Œ∏2) & 0 & L_1 \sin(Œ∏2) \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$ 
T_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(Œ∏3) & -\sin(Œ∏3) & 0 & L_2 \cos(Œ∏3) \\
\sin(Œ∏3) & \cos(Œ∏3) & 0 & L_2 \sin(Œ∏3) \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Composite Transformation

The composite transformation matrix \(T\) from the base to the end-effector is:

$$ 
T = T1 \cdot T2 \cdot T3
$$

To find the position \((x, y, z)\) of the end-effector, we extract the translation components from the final transformation matrix:

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
x &= L1 \cos(Œ∏1) + L2 \cos(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2) + L3 \cos(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2 + Œ∏3) \\
y &= L1 \sin(Œ∏1) + L2 \sin(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2) + L3 \sin(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2 + Œ∏3) \\
z &= d_1
\end{aligned}
$$

# Inverse Kinematics in 3D

Inverse kinematics involves finding the joint angles Œ∏1, Œ∏2, and Œ∏3 given the position \((x, y, z)\) of the end-effector.

## Steps to Solve Inverse Kinematics

1. **Calculate Œ∏1:**

   The first joint angle Œ∏1 can be found using:

   $Œ∏1 = \arctan2(y, x)$

2. **Calculate the Position of the Wrist Center:**

   The wrist center is the position where the third link starts. This can be found as:

   $x_w = x - L_3 \cos(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2 + Œ∏3)$
   
   $y_w = y - L_3 \sin(Œ∏1 + Œ∏2 + Œ∏3)$
   
   $z_w = z - d_1$

4. **Calculate Œ∏2 and Œ∏3:**

   Using the wrist center coordinates, we can form a triangle with sides L1, L2, and the distance from the base to the wrist center \((r)\):

   $r = \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2}$

   The angle Œ∏2 can be found using the law of cosines:

   $\cos(Œ∏2) = \frac{r^2 + L1^2 - L2^2}{2 L1 r}$
   
   $Œ∏2 = \arccos\left(\frac{r^2 + L1^2 - L2^2}{2 L1 r}\right)$

   The angle Œ∏3 can be determined as:

   $Œ∏3 = \arctan2(z_w, \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2}) - Œ∏2$
